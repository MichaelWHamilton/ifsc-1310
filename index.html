                <p>
                    History and faq page needs something to break up the content.<br>
                    More could be done with the homepage. I was told it was boring as it was.<br>
                    Some links didn’t work.

                    After receiving feedback, I tried to make as many changes as I could to make the site overall more interesting from a consumer perspective. I made it interactive and added breaks in color or lines to break up content. I first started by making sure all my links were working as they should. This helped the navigation flow much more smoothly. I was told that my worst page was the faq page, and they were right. Originally, my faq page was simply a wall of text. It was hard to read and decipher when one question ended and another started. To fix this, I made each question have an alternating background color similar to my homepage. Each alternated from dark to light and made things much more readable. I wasn’t quite satisfied with this alone, so I changed the padding a little bit and also added a border to the bottom and top of each paragraph. I felt like this helped break the content up better. The next page that the content needed a break was the history page. This page doesn’t have a lot of content in the first place, but it didn’t look right having the paragraphs of brief history sit right atop of the table of recent missions. I didn’t think that each section needed different background colors in this case, so I changed the spacing a bit and added a line spanning between the history paragraphs and the table. This addition helps the readability of the page. My favorite changes I made were on the homepage of the project. I was told the information was good, but overall, there were some things off and it was kind of boring. For example, my photos were not all the same size in the articles, so it looked kind of awkward. Also, the images didn’t exactly match the content that they were displayed above. To fix these things, and make them overall more interesting, I changed the images to some that I thought were more suitable, and I cropped them all to the exact same dimensions. I fixed some alignment issues and made the articles pop a little while hovering over them. To do this I made them all slightly grey-white. When hovering, the background color turns white, the border extends a little and the entire article grows in size. This gives emphasis to what the user is reading while hovering over the content. Lastly, I added a picture slideshow to make the page more interesting.

                Overall, I really enjoyed this semester. This has got to be one of my favorite classes I have taken so far. Not only because of the content that I was able to learn, but the teaching style really worked for how I learn. To be honest, I didn’t even know what to expect or what we would even be covering when enrolling for this class. I just knew I needed it for my degree and must have missed it when I started attending. If I regret anything, I wish I would have taken it much sooner. I am a CS major and really enjoy programming and this class really coincides with some of the things I have been learning in other classes. This semester has sparked an interest in web design for me and I plan on taking the courses next in line now. Some of the things I did well in this course was just playing with the content and not worrying about messing up. That’s how I learned, and I dabbled a lot here and there trying to absorb as much as I could. This project helped me learn fundamentals to web design and I enjoyed the process. Something else I did good was staying on top of the work and getting ahead. Some of my other finals were very taxing so I was able to focus on other classes here at the end because I had mostly everything done. Another thing I think I developed a good habit of was trouble shooting my CSS. If I couldn’t quite get spacing right, I would just play with it, try different things and eventually I’d get the result I was looking for.  One of the things I had trouble with early on was selecting content in CSS. I don’t know why, but I had a little learning curve with CSS selectors. I get it now, but it took me longer than I would have liked to get a good understanding of that.

                <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
                <p>Progress enhancement is a modern web design methodology. With so many tools available these days that offer customization to web design, this methodolgy is meant to ensure that the content of a web app reaches all users first, regardless of their platform. The way I see it is, this method is meant to make sure that the foundation of a web app comes first, no matter the platform you may be viewing content on. This is important because, even in our current time of computer advancement, not everyone has access to resources that allow them to use advanced browser features and augmented content. Once the foundation has been layed for all, then any further enhancement to the web app is gravy. An article I read, describes progressive enhancement as the rule of <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-progressive-enhancement/">"separation of presentation and content, separation of content and style, or separation of semantics and presentation."</a>. I couldn't say it any better. As long as the core material is there, all the extra stuff is just a bonus.  </p>
